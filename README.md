# HSHack2019

# This was created as a one day project for Hack I/O, and the Brain Health Hack challenge.
# Our goal was to create an application (starting off on Android) that helps users of various mental health conditions
# maintain their health and happiness by recognizing and monitoring ambient environmental factors and user input. We want
# to keep user privacy at a priority, but also have the ability to build a model to help all users.

# Team members: Drew Dorner, Alex Herridge, Afif Jamil, Billy
